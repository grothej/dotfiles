# dotfiles
Repository for personal dotfiles

### requirements:
- gnu-stow (> v2.4.0)
- git 

These configs are maintained and applied with stow. All configurations are maintained in packages, which  
are defined in the root-dir. To create a sym link to the corresponding target directory of a package use:
```bash
stow [package name]
```
Delete a symlink
```bash
stow -D [package name]
```

The default cli-options are defined in the [.stowrc file](./.stowrc).
